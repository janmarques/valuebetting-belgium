# +EV Value Sports Betting in Belgium

This document outlines some basics and lessons learned to get you started successfully sportsbetting using licensed Belgian sportsbooks.

## Introduction: what is value betting
When you and a friend each put 5 euro in the pot and then roll a die where you get the even numbers and you friend gets the odd numbers, (50% probability that you win, 2.0 odds on your money), your Expected Value (`=EV`) is 0. It is a fair game, and in the long run it is perfectly balanced and neither of you will come out ahead.

However when you each bet 5 euros, and you get numbers 1,2,3,4 and your friend gets 5,6 (66% probability that you win, 2.0 odds on your money), you have a huge advantage. In the long run you will come out ahead.

Value betting is about finding those opportunities where you have an advantage (so where your win probability is greater than the odds on your money).
